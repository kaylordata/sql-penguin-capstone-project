# Data Analyst Capstone Project @ NCLab: Palmer Penguins: SQL Analysis to Python Visualization
## Overview
This repository contains all the code, analysis, and documentation for my data analyst capstone project. The project focuses on using SQL (PostgreSQL) for data cleaning, exploration, and statistical modeling, and Python for visualization.

## Project Flow

The analysis follows these major phases:

1.  **Data Preparation (SQL):** Cleaning, subsetting, and performing initial transformations on the raw dataset.
2.  **Descriptive Analysis (SQL & Python):** Calculating key metrics, identifying data distributions, and preparing summary statistics.
3.  **Modeling & Visualization (Python):** Building a linear regression model to predict body mass from flipper length and creating visualizations to communicate findings.
4.  **Reporting:** Drawing conclusions and documenting the entire process.

## Repository Structure

The project files are organized into the following folders:

* **`SQL/`**: Contains all `.sql` scripts used for data cleaning, aggregation, and initial descriptive statistics.
* **`PYTHON/`**: Contains Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks (e.g., `.ipynb`) for statistical analysis, regression modeling, and generating final visualizations.
* **`DATA/`**: Holds the original raw data file (`raw_data.csv`) and the prepared, cleaned dataset used for modeling.
* **`REPORTS/`**: Contains the final written documentation (`final_report.pdf`) and project reflection.
